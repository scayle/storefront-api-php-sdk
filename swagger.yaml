    The SCAYLE Storefront API is a highly scalable REST API to access your product data in any customer-facing application.

    You can use the SCAYLE Storefront API to:
    * fetch your product data to be displayed anywhere
    * filter products by numerous filter criteria
    * search for products (full-text search)
    * save baskets or wishlists for individual customers
    * retrieve shop configuration

    # Core Concepts

    Core concepts of the Storefront API are:
    * **Variant**: Any distinct sellable item, for example: a blue colored shirt in size L. Available quantity/stock information is always on variant level.
    * **Product**: A product is a collection of one or more variants with some shared attributes, for example: A blue colored shirt (product) available in different sizes (variants). A product will be sold out when all its variants are sold out.
    * **Sibling**: A product closely related to another product, for example, the same shirt by the same brand, but in another color.
    * **Category**: Each product can be assigned to one or more category nodes in the category tree.
    * **Attribute**: Attributes are, for example, size, material, color. Attributes can be assigned to product level or variant level.
    * **Filter**: Any criteria available to filter a list of products, for example: an attribute or a category.
    * **Basket**: The basket holds variants that a customer intends to buy and has added to his shopping cart.
    * **Wishlist**: Customers can add variants to a wishlist to remember them or buy them later.

    # General API Information

    ## Content Type
    All API responses are returned with `Content-Type: application/json`.

    ## Multiple Shops
    In case you are operating multiple shops (for example, for different domain names or different languages), each shop is identified by its specific `shopId` or `countryId`.

    For all requests, the `shopId` or `countryId` can be provided as:
    * HTTP header `X-Shop-Id` or `X-Country-Id`, for example: `X-Shop-Id: 123` or `X-Country-Id: 123`
    * GET parameter `shopId` or `countryId`, for example `/v1/products?shopId=123` or `/v1/products?countryId=123`

    ## Authentication
    For protected endpoints of the Storefront API, please provide the access token in the HTTP header `X-Access-Token`.

    The access tokens are managed and retrieved from the Scayle Panel in the [API Keys](../../../en/next/manual/scayle/api-keys) section. The tokens for the Storefront API are the ones specified in the section *Storefront API Keys*.

    Below, you can see a CURL request example using a generic token. Please __replace it with your token collected from the SCAYLE Panel__ as described in the previous section.

    e.g:
    ```json
    curl -X GET \
      http://your-domain.com/v1/products
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'X-Access-Token: 434kdgkajdsfgjkajd13477asfadf123asdfasdfadad'
    ```
    __Note:__ After the token is generated in the Panel, it can take some time for changes to take effect.

      summary: Display a list of variants
      description: |
        Get multiple variants, either by specifying search criteria/filters or variant IDs.

        There are two basic ways to use this endpoint: You can either search for variants by specifying search/filter parameters or directly fetch known variants by their [variant IDs](../../../en/glossary#variant-id).

        ***

        __Searching for variants__

        The various `filter` parameters can be used to restrict the list of variants included in the response (see available parameters below).

        You can also use the `/v1/filters` endpoint to determine which filters are available in the current context. This way, you can, for example, enable users to narrow down general variant lists to very specific results by incrementally adding more and more filter parameters.

        The `minProductId`, `includeSellableForFree`, and `includeSoldOut` parameters can further restrict or expand the search results (see below).

        ***

        __Fetching variants by variant ID__

        To fetch a list of known variants, simply specify them by variant ID using the `ids` parameter, for example, `/v1/variants?ids=1,2,3`.

        If you specify the `ids` parameter, all other search/filter parameters will be ignored.

        ***

        __Selecting included variant data__

        By default, only basic variant data is included in the response. Use the `with` parameters (see below) to include more variant data.

        To see all available variant data, for example, for debugging, you might use unrestricted `with` parameters: `?with=attributes,advancedAttributes`.

        Beware of using unrestricted `with` parameters in production applications. It will result in slow performance, as download sizes for full variant data lists can be quite big. Including only exactly what is needed will be best for performance when downloading and parsing the result.

        A typical request for a variant list optimized for maximum performance is, for example, `?with=attributes:key(ean|shopSize),advancedAttributes:key(modelHeight)`.

      summary: Display a list of products
      description: |
        Requesting this API endpoint is the main way to retrieve your product data to display in any context. It will probably be your most used API request.

        There are two basic ways to use the endpoint: You can either search for products by specifying search/filter parameters or directly fetch known products by their product IDs.

        When you just query `/v1/products` without any parameter, you will be shown a list of the latest 100 products, sorted by their product ID (highest product ID first).

        ***

        __Searching for products__

        The various `filter` parameters can be used to restrict the list of products included in the response (see available parameters below).

        You can also use the `/v1/filters` endpoint to determine which filters are available in the current context. This way, you can, for example, enable users to narrow down general product lists to very specific results by incrementally adding more and more filter parameters.

        The `minProductId`, `includeSellableForFree`, and `includeSoldOut` parameters can further restrict or expand the search results (see below).

        ***

        __Fetching products by product ID__

        To fetch a list of known products, simply specify them by product ID using the `ids` parameter, for example, `/v1/products?ids=1,2,3`.

        If you specify the `ids` parameter, all other search/filter parameters will be ignored.

        ***

        __Selecting included product data__

        By default, only basic product data is included in the response. Use the `with` parameters (see below) to include more product data.

        To see all available product data, for example, for debugging, you might use unrestricted `with` parameters: `?with=attributes,advancedAttributes,categories,images.attributes,priceRange,reductionRange,siblings,variants.attributes,variants.advancedAttributes`.

        Beware of using these unrestricted `with` parameters in production applications. It will result in slow performance, as download sizes for full product data lists can be quite big. Including only exactly what is needed will be best for performance when downloading and parsing the result.

        A typical request for a product list optimized for maximum performance is, for example, `?with=attributes:key(brand|color),advancedAttributes:key(description),variants.attributes:key(vendorSize),images,priceRange,reductionRange`.

        ***

        __Sorting__

        You can order the results using different sorting strategies, based on the provided `sort`, `sortingKey`, and `sortDir` parameters.

        * __Default sorting__: If no sorting parameter is specified, the products will be sorted by product ID. To specify the order, use the `sortDir` parameter (default `desc`, highest product ID first).

        * __Price sorting__: `sort=price` will sort the results by price. To specify the order, use the `sortDir` parameter (default `desc`, highest price first).

        * __Reduction sorting__: `sort=reduction` will sort the results by price reduction. This sorting is based on the available `appliedReductions` for each product's variants. When a `campaignKey` is also provided, the sorting will also consider the campaign reduction. To specify the order, use the `sortDir` parameter (default `desc`, highest reduction first).

        * __Date sorting__: `sort=new` will order the products by `firstLiveAt` field. If `firstLiveAt` is not set the products will be ordered by creation date. To specify the order, use the `sortDir` parameter (default `desc`, most recent date first).

        * __Key sorting__: `sortingKey` will order the results based on your custom sorting keys, for example, `sortingKey=wcc-default`. If the `sortingKey` parameter has been provided, the `sort` parameter will be ignored.

        Each product can be assigned to one or more shop categories in a hierarchical shop category tree.
        You can set up and [modify your shop-specific category tree](../../../en/next/manual/scayle/categories) through the SCAYLE Panel.

        You can use `/categories?ids=123,456,789` to retrieve additional information about multiple categories.

        Category information includes:

        * `childrenIds`: child category IDs attached to the current category
        * `parentId`: parent category ID (root-level categories have a parent ID of `0`)
        * `depth`: nesting level of the category (root-level depth = 1, child nodes = 2, child nodes' children = 3, etc.)
        * `rootlineIds`: a list containing the current category ID and all parent IDs up to the root category level (depth 1).
        * `slug`: short text to describe the current category (usable, for example, in URLs as `fashion`).
        * `path`: slugs for all `rootlineIds` combined with `/` (e.g., `/women/fashion`).
        * `supportedFilter`: a list of filters that can be used for filtering products in the category (for example, `armLength` or `mainMaterial`).

        You can also get individual categories with `/v1/categories/{categoryId}` or `/v1/categories/{categoryPath}`.

        Get category information for the specified category path, for example, `/v1/categories/frauen/bekleidung`.

        Note: It is recommended to implement fetching category by an Id instead of by a Path, as this approach offers several advantages in terms of performance, consistency, and reduced error likelihood.

      summary: Get information about attributes
      description: |
        To work with attributes, we distinguish between __attribute groups__ and __attribute values__:
        * Each product can be assigned to many __attribute values__, for example: `white` or `M`.
        * Each attribute belongs to exactly one __attribute group__, for example: `color` or `size`.

        When generally talking about attributes, both [attribute groups](../../../en/next/manual/scayle/product-configuration#definition-of-attributes--attribute-groups) and attribute values are sometimes referred to as just __attributes__. To avoid confusion when addressing technical details, use the more specific terms __attribute groups__ and __attribute values__.

        You can set up and [modify your available attribute groups](../../../en/next/manual/scayle/product-configuration#master-attributes) and values through the Panel.

        You can use `/attributes` to retrieve all your attribute groups. The response will also include the available attribute values for each attribute group.

        To get only a few attribute groups, you can specify their attribute group IDs or their attribute group names, for example, `/attributes?ids=123,456,789` or `/attributes?name=color`.

        You can also get individual attribute groups and their attribute values with `/v1/attributes/{attributeGroupName}`.

      summary: Display matching combinations of attributes and categories
      description: |
        This endpoint is intended to improve the experience for your users when doing full-text searches.

        For example, when searching for `blue shirts M`, you might want to suggest to the user to visit the category `shirts`, filtered by the color attribute `blue` and the size attribute `M`.

        This endpoint helps you provide that, as it will search for matching combinations of attributes and categories. It will only include combinations that actually provide search results.

        For example, while searching for `blue shirts M`, the category `shirts` filtered by `blue` would not be included, if there are no blue shirts available.

        Still, the category `shirts` filtered by size attribute `M` would be included (ignoring `blue` because there would be no matching results).

        The request needs to match at least one category and one attribute. For example, searching for `blue M` would return no result at all (as it matches no category) and not suggest category `shirts` filtered by `blue` and `M`.

      summary: Get brands, categories, and products that best match the search term
      description: |
        The endpoint searches and returns:
        - brands by their name
        - categories by their name or their synonyms
        - products by their name, brand, and attributes (or attribute synonyms)

        When there is an exact one-to-one match present in the results, it is placed under the `topMatch` property. The rest of the results are sorted by relevancy and placed under the `suggestions` property. Sorting gives more weight to categories and brands, so products are generally placed below categories and brands.

        The suggestions array has two types of objects:
        - `BrandOrCategory` object, which is either a brand or category. Whether it is a brand or category can be identified by the property `primaryMatch`. The brand suggestions will also include the most relevant category under the `category` property.
        - product object

        When the search term finds a matching attribute, the attribute is then applied as a filter to the brand and category searches, adjusting the product count. Applied filters can be found under the `attributeFilters` property.

        **Please use the `?fullAttributeValue=true` parameter for all searches**. The old response that returns only attribute IDs is deprecated. The response will default to full attribute values in the future.

        **Note:** The typeahead endpoint supports both POST and GET requests, the difference is that the POST endpoint supports more parameters.

            The `with` parameter can be applied to include related resources, for example, the attributes of a product can be attached using `with=product.attributes`. It is also possible to filter product attributes by key `with=product.attributes:key(plusSize)` or by type `with=product.attributes:type(material_care)`. Nested includes can also be attached when available `with=product.variants.attributes` and multiple combinations are likewise accepted `with=prodcut.siblings,product.variants,category.children`. When using `with=category.children`, you can provide `categoryDepth` parameter to increase child depth. In the following table, there is more information about possible includes.

      summary: Get brands, categories, and products that best match the search term
      description:  |
        The endpoint searches and returns:
        - brands by their name
        - categories by their name or their synonyms
        - products by their name, brand, and attributes (or attribute synonyms)

        When there is an exact one-to-one match present in the results, it is placed under the `topMatch` property. The rest of the results are sorted by relevancy and placed under the `suggestions` property. Sorting gives more weight to categories and brands, so products are generally placed below categories and brands.

        The suggestions array has two types of objects:
        - `BrandOrCategory` object, which is either a brand or category. Whether it is a brand or category can be identified by the property `primaryMatch`. The brand suggestions will also include the most relevant category under the `category` property.
        - product object

        When the search term finds a matching attribute, the attribute is then applied as a filter to the brand and category searches, adjusting the product count. Applied filters can be found under the `attributeFilters` property.

        **Please use the `?fullAttributeValue=true` parameter for all searches**. The old response that returns only attribute IDs is deprecated. The response will default to full attribute values in the future.

        **Note:** The typeahead endpoint supports both POST and GET requests. The difference is that the POST endpoint supports more parameters.

            The `with` parameter can be applied to include related resources, for example, the attributes of a product can be attached using `with=product.attributes`. It is also possible to filter product attributes by key `with=product.attributes:key(plusSize)` or by type `with=product.attributes:type(material_care)`. Nested includes can also be attached when available `with=product.variants.attributes` and multiple combinations are likewise accepted `with=prodcut.siblings,product.variants,category.children`. When using `with=category.children`, you can provide `categoryDepth` parameter to increase child depth. In the following table, there is more information about possible includes
            Include | includes | Available Filters
            ------------ | ------------- | -------------

      summary: Display a list of available filters for filtering products
      description: |
        Filters should always be used whenever you want to display or reduce a list of products based on specific criteria. Therefore, we will now explain which filters are available and what you need to keep in mind when using this endpoint.
        * When you do not add extra parameters, you will be shown a list of default filters.
        * During the initial configuration, we will set up a list of default filters with you for your specific needs.
        * You can also [configure filters for each category](../../../en/next/manual/scayle/search-products#product-filters) through the Panel.
        * When adding the `with=values` parameter, the response will include the resulting product counts for the combination of the filters used.

        As an example, the following request: `/v1/filters?filters[category]=235870)&filters[sale]=true` will restrict the response to include only the available filter values and product counts for a specific category for products on sale.
        In the next section, all the available filters will be described in detail.


        __Note__: Inactive products (sold out) are always automatically filtered out from the filter's response, and they are not taken into account for any of the described filters below.

        Baskets are created on demand when the first variant is added to the basket.

        Choose a unique string as `basketId` to add variants to a new basket and to retrieve the same basket later.

        Only one variant can be added to the basket with each request. Use multiple requests to add more variants.

        The variant and quantity to be added is specified in the POST request body (see below). The only strictly required parameter is `variantId` and `quantity`.

        Add to basket quantity should be a numeric value and always greater than zero(0). e.g: - `quantity: 1(or more)`.

        The response will show the updated content of the basket.
